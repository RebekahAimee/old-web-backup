# old-web-backup
Some web design stuff I did when I was about 14 or 15. I haven't looked through it in a while, but I'm still holding out hopes that the web sites involved might eventually get finished.

This is here for my own benefit, not really as an open source project. I don't mind if people want to look through it, though, keeping in mind that it was written by a teenager and may not be the best code. Or it might be just fine. I don't remember.
